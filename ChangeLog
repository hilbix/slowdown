	* slowdown.c (set_delay): Bug removed if you happen to set delay
	of exactly 2^32 ms.
	(delay_trace): Reparenting is undone in case of PTRACE_ATTACH was
	done.  Hopefully.  So with "slowdown 1 pid" you can start the
	slowdown, then terminate the slowdown and do a "slowdown 0 pid" to
	re-awake it.

	* slowdown.c (do_delay): delays are now measured, such that too
	small delay counts (those below the system timer resolution) can
	be compensated.

	* README (NOTES): Note about the new improved delay method.

	* slowdown.c (set_delay): changed such, that values are prepared
	for improved delay routine.

	* README (BUGS): SIGTSTP problems

	* slowdown.c: bytes and loops added
	(delay_trace): number of loops corrected
	(delay_trace): commented and minor improvements
	(delay_trace): default return changed to 129, as this is the usual
	return in case a uncought exception happened.
	(delay_trace): do_delay() moved before the PTRACE_SYSCALL to
	recuce the concurrency.
	(delay_trace): "unknown wait status" added

	* slowdown.c (delay_trace): fork() can return errors, now this is
	checked
