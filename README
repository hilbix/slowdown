What is slowdown?

Often things are just too fast.  For example

	find / -type f -ls | awk -f process.awk

might eat up so much system IO that the system becomes unresponsive.
This is where slowdown comes into place.  In this case you can write:

	find / -type f -ls | slowdown 50 | awk -f process.awk

which means, only process 20 lines per second.  Also it can be used to
slowdown processes like my md5backup which often tears down the system
too hard.  Slowdown shall be the solution to it.

Usage: slowdown delay [process [args..]]

delay is in milliseconds

If the process is missing it acts as a filter from stdin to stdout
such that it delays the IO the given delay each line or BLKSIZ (4096)
bytes, whatever comes first.  Also it runs unbuffered, such that it
writes lines to stdout in a flushed mode.  Always as you expect it.

If process is given, it is started "traced", that is, it is delayed
each time it does a SYSCALL.  Except from this it just behaves as if
it is not there and sends all the signals it receives to the child, so
it's like it isn't there.

Also you can attach to other processes by giving the PID as the
process name in case you do not give any args.

That's just the complete idea behind slowdown.

Note that there is a similar project at freshmeat:
     http://freshmeat.net/projects/slowdown/
So if my version does not help you, perhaps the other can.

BUGS:
-----

- If delay is below the resolution of the system timer, the waits are
  over-estimated, so the overall delay is too high.  Perhaps a future
  version fixes this.

- fork()s of the child processes are not followed.  This is the new
  child processes are not traced as well.  This shall be the default
  behavior, though.

- If slowdown terminates, the traced process stays in the traced
  state, so it does stop running.  There shall be an automatic detach
  somehow.
