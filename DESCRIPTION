Slowdown processes or pipes.

Note that there is a similar <A
HREF="http://freshmeat.net/projects/slowdown/">project called slowdown
at freshmeat.net</A> running under SunOS and Linux.

My version here is designed for modern Linux only to slowdown pipes
and processes.  It slowdowns all syscalls, not only the IO ones.
It can be used as a pipe, can slowdown forked processes and attach
to already running processes (this nowadays needs root).

For more please look into README.md
