Minor bugfix and added "slowdown 0 PID" to detach a "hung" process.

If you attach to a process with something like

slowdown 100 PID

and then kill slowdown with ^C, this very likely leaves a hung PID,
because slowdown (not yet) detaches the PID and leaves it in the
traced state.  You now can recover from this using

slowdown 0 PID

which immediately (nearly) undoes the trace effect.  Note that it's
likely that you don't see this effect easily if you use

slowdown 1 PID

as the minimal timer resolution usually is somewhat around 15, so a
faster timer is faked such that it's likely that you do not kill
slowdown when the child is in traced state.
